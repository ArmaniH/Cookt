Cookt: Recipes

Trello - https://trello.com/b/GqPRfJfa

As a User...
1. I can search the Edamam API ('https://api.edamam.com/search') for recipes and have the results displayed on the page.
2. I can select a recipe to have it's details further displayed in an iframe.
3. I can open a timer to countdown cooking time. I can submit details as to what the timer is for.
4. Optionally, I can submit a mobile phone number to be alerted via SMS through the ClockworksSMS API ('https://api.clockworksms.com/').

~ Adding multiple timers is causing errors.
~ The recipe API I am using can be a little bit complicated so parsing though more than the displayed results is proving difficult.
~ I'd like to add a method to breakout of the iframe.
